We want to send the pose information generated 
by the turtlesim node at our "robot" (0) to our "cloud" (1)

/*  
Note that we can verify that the pose is published by turtlesim every 15 ms (or so) 
but we can only estimate how frequently the teleop_key will be publishing (500 ms seems 
reasonable for someone operating a keyboard)
